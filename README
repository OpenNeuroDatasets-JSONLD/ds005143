# Spinal Cord fMRI Segmentation Database (Multi-Subject)

This multi-site data set is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Each participant's data is in one subdirectory, which contains the mean of motion-corrected volumes  (the mean image that was used to draw the spinal cord mask) as well as the associated metadata.

## Dataset Details:
We gathered gradient-echo EPI datasets from multiple sites (15 sites, 406 participants in total). All volunteers provided written informed consent following Institutional Review Board approval and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participating sites were asked to share (i) the first 20 motion-corrected EPI volumes of the functional run, (ii) the BIDS-compatible JSON file containing information about the acquisition, (iii) the mean image of the motion-corrected data, and (iv) the SC segmentation based on the mean motion-corrected image. Out of 406 volunteers across all sites, the majority were healthy volunteers (n=359), 17 volunteers had degenerative cervical myelopathy, and 30 volunteers had fibromyalgia.

Spinal cord masks that were generated based on mean of motion-corrected volumes are found under derivatives/label/sub-<subjectID>/<sub-subjectID>_task-rest_desc-spinalcordmask.nii.gz.
